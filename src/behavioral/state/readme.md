## Overview
The State pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior at runtime by changing its internal state. It is useful when an object needs to change its behavior depending on its internal state, and when the number of states is large and/or when the transition logic between states is complex.

## Initial Problem
In some cases, an object needs to change its behavior depending on its internal state. One way to do this is to use a conditional statement to switch between behaviors based on the current state. However, this approach can lead to code that is hard to read and maintain, especially when the number of states and the transition logic between them is complex. The State pattern solves this problem by encapsulating each state as a separate object, and by defining a common interface for all states. The object then delegates its behavior to the current state object, which can change at runtime.

## When to Apply
The State pattern is useful in the following situations:

* When an object needs to change its behavior dynamically depending on its internal state.
* When the number of states is large and/or when the transition logic between states is complex.
* When you want to avoid using conditional statements to switch between behaviors based on the current state.
* When you want to separate the responsibilities of an object's behavior and its state into separate objects.

In general, the State pattern is useful in any situation where you need to manage the behavior of an object based on its internal state, and where you want to avoid using conditional statements to switch between behaviors. It is also useful when you need to add new states or change the behavior of existing states dynamically, without modifying the object's code.
