## Creational Patterns
Creational Patterns are used to create objects in a flexible and reusable way. They provide a standard way to create objects that can be used in different situations. Some examples of Creational Patterns are:

* Singleton Pattern: This pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created and provides global access to it.
* Factory Method Pattern: This pattern provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.
* Abstract Factory Pattern: This pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects.
* Builder Pattern: This pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation and allows the same construction process to create different representations.
* Prototype Pattern: This pattern creates new objects by cloning existing ones, allowing for a more efficient way of creating objects that are similar but not identical.

## Structural Patterns
Structural Patterns are used to organize classes and objects into larger structures. They provide a way to simplify relationships between objects and classes, making it easier to manage complex software systems. Some examples of Structural Patterns are:

* Adapter Pattern: This pattern adapts an existing interface to meet the needs of a new interface.
* Bridge Pattern: This pattern separates an object's interface from its implementation, allowing for more flexibility in how objects are used.
* Composite Pattern: This pattern allows objects to be treated as a tree structure, with each object having the same interface.
* Decorator Pattern: This pattern adds new functionality to an existing object dynamically, without changing its interface.
* Facade Pattern: This pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex system, making it easier to use and understand.
* Flyweight Pattern: This pattern shares objects to reduce memory usage, improving performance.
* Proxy Pattern: This pattern provides a placeholder for another object to control access, reduce cost, and enhance functionality.

## Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral Patterns are used to manage the behavior and communication between objects and classes. They provide a way to organize and manage complex interactions, making it easier to develop and maintain software systems. Some examples of Behavioral Patterns are:

* Chain of Responsibility Pattern: This pattern allows multiple objects to handle a request, with each object potentially passing the request on to the next object in the chain.
* Command Pattern: This pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing it to be queued, logged, and undoable.
* Interpreter Pattern: This pattern defines a grammar for interpreting a language and provides a way to evaluate sentences in that language.
* Iterator Pattern: This pattern provides a way to access the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying implementation.
* Mediator Pattern: This pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, making it easier to manage and modify the interactions.
* Memento Pattern: This pattern allows an object to capture its internal state and restore it later, without violating encapsulation.
* Observer Pattern: This pattern allows objects to be notified when a change occurs in another object.
* State Pattern: This pattern allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.
* Strategy Pattern: This pattern defines a family of algorithms and allows them to be used interchangeably within an object.
* Template Method Pattern: This pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, with specific steps left to be implemented by subclasses.
* Visitor Pattern: This pattern separates the algorithms from the objects on which they operate, allowing new algorithms to be added without changing the objects.
